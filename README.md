# C/C++
2009 First baby steps in the beautiful world of coding. 

Very simple programs in C/C++ to start learning what programming is. 
After C/C++ everything else is easier :-)

I had a lot of fun doing small programs that allows me to learn programming concepts and to gain experience about how computer and software is.

Love to #code, build and have fun in the process.
